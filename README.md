# Simple-ChatBot

This is a simple ChatBot made using Python and Tensorflow / Keras.
It's not a super smart chatbot. It can only learn to recognize user added Patterns in the file 'intents.json'.

# Train the model
It is very easy to train the model, just run simple-chatbot.py and it will start training the model.

# Interact with your bot
If your training is finished and a new file named 'model.keras' appears in your working directory that means 
you have done everything correctly, now just run the same simple-chatbot.py file to chat with your bot.
